# Off-Switch Game Reproductions

This script reproduces some of the plots from Hafield-Menell's [Off-Switch Game paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08219).

I wrote this to get a better understanding of what the paper was doing. It's kind of slow to run, and I'm unlikely to bother optimizing it more.

## Running

```
python3 off_switch.py
```

This will save several plots to the pwd from the first few sections of the paper.
